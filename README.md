# ModSorter by Mehni

Tired of having to wait ages just to (de)activate a mod? Spending more time shuffling the order around then you do playing? Bored of downloading a mod, starting the game to activate it, then restarting the game again? This ModSorter is a tool that lets you organise your mods without starting the game!

## Features

- Can sort mods.
- Can deactivate mods.
- Can activate mods.
- Can search through that 300+ long modlist to find that one special mod you need to activate.
- Crashes when you do really dumb stuff. ~~I tried to make it idiot-proof, but the local idiot ran off so I tested my own stuff.~~ Update: Local idiot located fun bugs and edge cases, upgraded to local hero.
